  content: "Murder Mystery 2 made me laugh. What more do you need from an Adam Sandler Netflix original?  Murder Mystery 2â€¦ It won't dazzle critics, but for people who enjoy a good laugh and Adam Sandler fans, this movie will be a blast! This marks the third film pairing Adam Sandler with Jennifer Aniston, and their chemistry takes Murder Mystery 2 from ridiculous to charming and entertaining. If you enjoyed the first movie, the sequel continues all the dynamics and hilarity that made its predecessor successful with a little more polish and experience. The fight scene in the van had me laughing so hard my wife judged me a little ðŸ˜†. The cheese bit and other reoccurring gags were undoubtedly immatureâ€¦ but pretty funny and exactly what you would expect of an Adam Sandler film. Don't compare this movie to Knives Out or Glass Onion. Instead, compare it to Happy Gilmore and The Wedding Singer with a little more murder. Murder Mystery 2 is a Netflix streaming sequel, so don't set your expectations high, but Adam Sandler fans and people that just want a good time will enjoy it.",
